## Documentation

### Firstly
Ok so i recommend you to install a complex code editor like the portable version of "[**Sublime Text 3**](https://download.sublimetext.com/Sublime Text Build 3143 x64.zip)".

You can also use another editor like "**Atom**", "**notpad++**" (yes somebody use notepad++, probably some really boring person), or maybe the "**windows notpad**", etc... Anyway.

### Configuring your graphic settings
**Open** the `video.txt` file with your new fabulous text editor

You will probably see something like that :

    "VideoConfig"
    {
        "setting.cpu_level"                      "0"
        "setting.gpu_level"                      "0"
        "setting.mat_antialias"                  "0"
        "setting.mat_aaquality"                  "0"
        "setting.mat_forceaniso"                 "0"
        "setting.mat_vsync"                      "0"
        "setting.mat_triplebuffered"             "0"
        "setting.mat_grain_scale_override"       "1"
        "setting.csm_quality_level"              "0"
        "setting.mat_software_aa_strength"       "0"
        "setting.mat_motion_blur_enabled"        "0"
        "setting.fullscreen"                     "1"
        "setting.defaultres"                  "1920"
        "setting.defaultresheight"            "1080"
        "setting.aspectratiomode"                "0"
        "setting.nowindowborder"                 "0"
    }

_I don't will explain you all of those lines but you will learn the basics._

So that is your graphic settings in csgo

#### Let's set this up
1. **Start** csgo
